# WorldGuardBatch

Plugin to execute batch commands in WorldGuard

## Commands
Commands are executed in world context. The command is only applied to regions in the current world.

Regions can by identified with an auto increment counter and regex for the name or by owner of the region.

Auto increment works with a placeholder and one or two bounds.  
To select region_1 to region_100 you have to write:  
`/<command> count region_\* 1 100`  
You dont have to type the first number, if it is zero.

Regex is a bit more complex. Google will be your friend.

### Membership

## Downloads and automatic builds
Prebuilt jars are available on the [Releases](../../releases) page.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/minecraft-release.yml`) checks Mojang's version manifest every 6 hours.
When a new Minecraft release appears and no release for it exists yet, it:

1. Builds the plugin against the Spigot API for that Minecraft version (`<version>-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`).
2. Publishes a GitHub release tagged `mc-<version>`, titled `WorldGuardBatch-<version>`, with the jar `WorldGuardBatch-<plugin version>-mc<version>.jar` attached.
3. Marks it as the latest release if it is Mojang's newest version.

If the build fails (for example because the Spigot API for that version is not published yet), nothing is released and the next scheduled run tries again.

You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab and optionally enter a specific Minecraft version.
To build locally against another version, run `mvn clean package -Dspigot.version=<version>-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`.
